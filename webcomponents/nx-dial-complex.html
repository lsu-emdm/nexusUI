            - number should not transmit out via general nx transmit
                (number should only control dial, not send data out)
            - number should not be in nx.widgets[] . really, the multiple items here need to be grouped together as one nx.widget
            - number must automatically know min/max of dial
                AND if that range is changed on the dial, should change 
                on the number too.
            - number needs to just be itself, not embedded in spans with the fake canvas
            - dial needs to be full height of container, - height of number
            - how to know how big to make the numbers? 
                maybe that is a global nx setting?
            - ***** must be able to style web components with regular CSS.
                currently not possible. *****

            therefore, I am not pursuing web components further
